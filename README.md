# Election-of-candidates
## Abstract
We attempted to design a system that complements rather than completely replaces the current voting method. We decided to do this in order to provide as many options to vote as possible, allowing the majority of the population to vote. As a result, we wrote code in C to select a candidate. As a result, we devised a solution to this difficulty. In any country, democratic voting is a critical and serious event. A paper-based method is the most prevalent technique for a country to vote. However, consider implementing e-voting technologies with the goal of enhancing many parts of the electoral process.
## Introduction
Our project is about an electronic voting system.This E voting technique is useful during elections to reduce the chance of casting illicit ballots. There is no need to print paper ballots to vote using this method. The standardisation or implementation of such an E voting system would be a step towards public acceptance of electronic voting schemes, provided the system is secure and has been tested and tried. The revelation of new protocols with security vulnerabilities does not advance public approval and, ultimately, the replacement of paper elections.
## Objective
The goal of this initiative is to increase trust in electoral management, give legitimacy to election outcomes, and improve overall electoral efficiency. This project allows us to count and save data on votes cast for each contender. Our primary goal is to make the voting process accessible to all voters.
